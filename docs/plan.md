# TODO

Register package in Julia registry:
- Check rules: name similarity, requirements for automatic acceptance?
- Update Documenter docs with an API page and coordinate system images/definitions
- Implement functions `x`, `y`, and `z` for `CoordinateSpherical`

Other:
- Finish writing tests and deploy a GitHub Action to run them
- Maybe implement getproperty methods for non-Unicode accessors
