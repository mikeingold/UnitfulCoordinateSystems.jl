`UnitfulCoordinateSystems.jl` is a simple and efficient implementation of common coordinate
systems with `Unitful` dimensions. These systems include, as defined by the standards
in ISO 80000-2:2019:
- Rectangular (x, y)
- Polar (x, y)
- Cartesian (x, y, z)
- Cylindrical (r, $\varphi$, z)
- Spherical (r, $\varphi$, $\theta$)
